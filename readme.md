### Project Description

The sole purpuse of our project is to mislead our users. This project is a ~productivity~ site that is dedicated to the work-holic minority among us. The site tries its best to distract the user from their task/work.

  

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Work-holic people are too productive. Some work overtime without focusing on themselves and their happiness.They require their lifetime dose of dopamine.

  

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

the production site does it's maximum to distract the user from their work.It also misleads the user's life that he is mory likely to backbite his friends and relatives leaving depriving the person of their social status leading him to be much more ~productive~.

added to the list.
